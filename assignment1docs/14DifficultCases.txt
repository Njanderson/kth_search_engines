1. Evelyn_Silvia
After looking through matches of various people, I chose to give Evelyn_Silvia a 1 because she contributed to the Mathematics graduate program at UC Davis with her work. She "spearheaded the creation of the Master of Arts in Teaching program here at UC Davis, a graduate program focusing on training future mathematics teachers," so even divorced from teaching Math graduate classes, she did create a Math education graduate program. There is also a link to the more relevant Mathematics page.

2. Statistics
Unlike the more engineering or other natural science-related graduate programs, Statistics is considered by many to be a Math graduate program. Potentially, those looking for a graduate program in Mathematics should consider Statistics, and they acknowledge that many Statistics graduate students were Math majors for undergrad. There is also a link to the Mathematics department.

3. University_Departments
A listing of the UC Davis departments gives an overview of all the programs within UCD, which could help with the information need of knowing where the Mathematics Graduate Program stacks up within UCD academics. Furthermore, it informs seachers that the Mathematics department, and therefore the graduate program of Mathematics is under the "Division of Mathematical and Physical Sciences." There is also a link to the Mathematics department.

4. What_I_Wish_I_Knew...Before_Coming_to_UC_Davis_Entomology
Describes graduate programs in general, which is relatively helpful even for Mathematics majors. It doesn't directly describe education, but it does talk about the graduate school experience.
